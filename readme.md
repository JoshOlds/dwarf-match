#Dwarf Match

---
This project demonstrates Angular 1 usage, and can be used as a launching point for setting up future Angular apps.
Dwarf Match is a recreation of a simple 'Memory' card flipping game. This particular interpretation uses 'Dwarf' styled cards.

This project also demonstrates handling of large data sets, as well as time-specific functions related to game loops.

As a highlight, this project also contains an auto-solver AI. This AI can solve the memory game in the minimum number of moves with no previous knowledge of the card locations!
